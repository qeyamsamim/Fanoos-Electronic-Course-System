# QuickBooksEcourse

This web-based single page application is developed for [Fanoos Accounting Services](https://fanoos.af/) to manage their QuickBooks and other accounting-related classes online. This web app is currently connected to Firebase in the backend, however, Node.js will be added later to the application.
This web application has three interfaces including students, instructors, and admin panel. The user-friendly studentsâ€™ interface is designed to allow students enroll and attend classes online while instructors can post materials to the classes. Admin is able to manage (edit, delete, and add) every single detail in the system. 
All files are categorized based on the components, services, and shared folder. The structure of the files in the project is tree like which means there are parent components followed by their child components. Currently, two different categories of folders can be found in the project which are components and pipes. Components contain all the file related to the interface and Pipes contain files which are used for data transformation or filtering data.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.0.
